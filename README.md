## What is it?
Leveling is an app that is use to improve someone lifestyle by making their everyday life into a game. Can be from day to day activity like doing chores and can also track something to do
for a week, a month, and even a year.

## Technology Used
In this app, I use a few technology to help me:
- Kotlin = use for the business logic
- Jetpack Compose = use for the UI instead of the basic XML
- Firebase = use for authentication and FireStore for the database

## How it works
this app works by making the user do the task they have made. After they finish the task, they will get gold. That can be "exchanged" to reward them self.
Can be a single cone of ice cream or even something more expensive.
